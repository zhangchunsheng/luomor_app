# SORelativeDateTransformer #

SORelativeDateTransformer is a value transformer that generates a human-readable phrase expressing the relative difference between a given date and the current date.

For example, when the current date-time is 2010-12-05 11:30, then

... 2010-12-05 11:00 is transformed to "30 minutes ago"

... 2010-12-01 11:00 is transformed to "5 days ago"

... 2010-12-25 08:00 is transformed to "in 2 weeks"

The transformer does not provide reverse transformations; you can only transform from an NSDate to an NSString.

## How To Use ##

Add the source files and localized strings bundle to your project.

	SORelativeDateTransformer.h
	SORelativeDateTransformer.m
	SORelativeDataTransformer.bundle

Create an instance of SORelativeDateTransformer wherever you need to generate relative date phrases.

	// Display a file's creation date relative to today's date
	NSURL *someFilePath = ...;
	NSDictionary *attribs = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] attributesOfItemAtPath:someFilePath error:NULL];
	
	NSDate *dateModified = [attribs fileModificationDate];
	
	// fileModificationDate is 2010-10-01 12:00:00TZ; 
	// Date now is 2010-10-30 12:00:00TZ
	
	SORelativeDateTransformer *relativeDateTransformer = [[SORelativeDateTransformer alloc] init];
	NSString *relativeDate = [relativeDateTransformer transformedValue: dateModified];
	
	NSLog (@"This file was modified %@.", relativeDate); // ==> "This file was modified 3 weeks ago."
	
## Localization ##

The accompanying bundle, `SORelativeDateTransformer.bundle`, provides localizations for the date component names and their plural forms. 

Included localizations:

* English
* Japanese
* French
* German
* Spanish
* Dutch
* Simplified Chinese
* Traditional Chinese

The localization also includes NSString-compatible format templates for phrases expressing relative past and future dates.  

* For past dates, the format template for the English phrase is `"%d %@ ago"`. E.g. 20 minutes ago
* For future dates, the format template is `"in %d %@"`. E.g. in 20 minutes

To add your own localizations, copy the English localization within `SORelativeDateTransformer.bundle` directory to an appropriately named `.lproj` subdirectory, then edit the `.strings` file within that new localization subdirectory.

For example, to add an Italian localization:

	# Change working directory to the SORelativeDateTransformer.bundle
	
	cd ${PROJECT_DIR}/SORelativeDateTransformer.bundle
	
	# Copy the English localization subdirectory
	# to an appropriately named lproj directory for an Italian localization
	
	cp -R en.lproj it.lproj
	
	# Edit the .strings file within the Italian lproj directory
	# to replace the English localization values with Italian equivalents.
	# Use your favorite UTF-16-capable text editor.
	
	mate it.lproj/SORelativeDateTransformer.strings

## Tester App ##

Included is an iOS 4 interactive testing application. You can a date from the date picker and see the generated relative date string below.

## Compatibility ##

SORelativeDateTransformer is compatible with iOS 4 and later, and Mac OS X 10.4 and later. Supports use in ARC and non-ARC projects.

Use it, hack it, but give me some love.
