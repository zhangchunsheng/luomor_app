I would like to thank open source community. Without them, I probably need much more time to finish this project. \\

I would also like to thank Jakob Eriksson and Ugo Buy. Prof. Eriksson gave me a lot of valuable suggestion for my project. Prof. Eriksson and Prof. Buy both give a good evaluation of my work. \\

Special thanks to all my friends who made tremendous comments about my app and all my colleagues in EXACT Sports LLC who slow me down in the right way so that I can make the project better. \\
